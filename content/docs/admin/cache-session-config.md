### Cookie Configuration

Browser cookies are used to track sessions when using BookStack. The following session cookie options can be set in your `.env` file:

```bash
# Only send cookies over a HTTPS connection.
# Ensure you have BookStack served over HTTPS before enabling.
# Defaults to 'false'
SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true

# Set the name of the cookie used by BookStack to track sessions.
# Defaults to 'bookstack_session'
SESSION_COOKIE_NAME=custom_cookie_name
```

### Cache & Session Storage

By default BookStack will use a file system cache that's storage in the `storage/framework` folder. This is also used to store user session data. Below are some alternative systems that can be used for caching & sessions.

#### Database

As an easy alternative to using the filesystem, you can use the database to store the cache and session. The database setup for this is done when installing/updating BookStack so you simply need to set the following in your `.env` file:

```bash
CACHE_DRIVER=database
SESSION_DRIVER=database
```

#### Memcached

To use memcached for caching and/or sessions open up your `.env` file and find the `CACHE_DRIVER` & `SESSION_DRIVER` variables. By default these are both set to `file`. Change these variables to `memcached`. You will also need to add a variable to specify the memcached servers you are using. To do this add a variable named `MEMCACHED_SERVERS` to the `.env` file and set the value to be your memcached servers in the following format: `HOST:PORT:WEIGHT,HOST2:PORT:WEIGHT`. You can specify as many servers as you want. Their usage split will be determined by the weight given to them. Here are some examples of what the `.env` file should look like:

```bash
# Set both the cache and session to use memcached
CACHE_DRIVER=memcached
SESSION_DRIVER=memcached

# Example of using a single local memcached server
MEMCACHED_SERVERS=127.0.0.1:11211:100

# Example of using two non-local memcached servers with an equal split
MEMCACHED_SERVERS=8.8.8.8:11211:50,8.8.4.4:11211:50
```

#### Redis

To use Redis for caching and/or sessions open up your `.env` file and find the `CACHE_DRIVER` & `SESSION_DRIVER` variables. By default these are both set to `file`. Change these variables to `redis`. You will need to add a variable to specify your Redis servers. To do this add a variable named `REDIS_SERVERS` to the `.env` file and set the value to point at your Redis servers in the following format: `HOST:PORT:DATABASE,HOST2:PORT:DATABASE`. The default values for each host are `127.0.0.1:6379:0`. You can list as many servers as you like.  

To specify if you would like to cluster you Redis servers create a `REDIS_CLUSTER` key in the `.env` file and set it to `true`. This option, if set to true, will instruct the built-in Redis client to perform client-side sharding across your Redis nodes, allowing them to pool together for a large amount of RAM. This disadvantage of this it that it does not allow for fail-over.

Here's an example of setting the Redis configuration:

```bash
# Set both the cache and session to use Redis
CACHE_DRIVER=redis
SESSION_DRIVER=redis

# Example of using a single local Redis server
REDIS_SERVERS=127.0.0.1:6379:0

# Example of using two non-local Redis servers clustered together
REDIS_SERVERS=8.8.8.8:6379:0,8.8.4.4:6379:0
REDIS_CLUSTER=true
```
