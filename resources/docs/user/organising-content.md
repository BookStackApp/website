# Organising Content

Once your BookStack instance starts to grow you will find that you may want to re-organise your content. Within BookStack there are two options for moving content around; Either you can move pages and chapters individually or you can sort entire books.

Note that to move content you will need to have 'edit' permission for both the content being moved and the parent it's being moved into.

### Moving Single Books & Chapters

Books and chapters can be moved directly to a new chapter or book. To move a chapter or page in this way go to a page or chapter and select 'Move' in the overflow menu, found on the right-hand side of the top toolbar:

Clicking the 'Move' action will take you to a screen where you can select a new location for your chapter or page. Here you can search for a particular book or chapter using the search bar at the top of the selection screen. Once you select a new parent for your chapter or book press 'Move Page' or 'Move Chapter' and your chapter or page will be moved to the new chapter or book. If you move a chapter all child pages will remain in that chapter and any related activity will now show up under the new parent book.

### Sorting Books

The 'Book Sort' interface allows you to move multiple pages and chapters with ease in a simple drag and drop interface. To sort a book simply go to the book and select 'Sort' in the overflow menu (3 vertical dots found next to the edit button) at the top right of the page and you will be directed to the sort view:

Initially, just the book you came from will show on the left. You can add extra books into the sort interface by selecting them on the right. Here you can simply drag and drop chapters and pages around and also between different books. Once you have organised your content press 'Save' and all included books will be re-organised.
