Following on from the release of v0.28, we've had a series of patch releases to 
apply a range of fixes & enhancements in addition to some translation updates.
There's nothing urgent or security related in these but they collectively include 
quite a few fixes so it's still worth updating.

* [Update instructions](https://www.bookstackapp.com/docs/admin/updates)
* GitHub release pages: [v0.28.1](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/releases/tag/v0.28.1), [v0.28.2](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/releases/tag/v0.28.2), [v0.28.3](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/releases/tag/v0.28.3)


### LDAP Authentication Updates 🔒

Within these releases, some attention has been paid to the LDAP auth system which specifically
improves compatibility with Active Directory. Within v0.28.0 we made it possible 
to specify the stored ID attribute that will be stored to relate users.
Unfortunately this was not compatible with AD's `objectGUID` attribute since 
it's provided in a raw binary format. In these updates we've made it possible
to prefix the attribute name with `BIN;` to specific it's a binary attribute like so:

```shell
LDAP_ID_ATTRIBUTE=BIN;objectGUID
```

BookStack will convert the value to hex for storage. Note, if you change this 
value after already using LDAP you'll need to update any stored user 
"External Authentication ID's" within BookStack.

It's also now possible to set a `LDAP_DUMP_USER_DETAILS=true` option to help debug
user details provided to BookStack, by the LDAP system, which can be very useful when
setting up and debugging group sync.

The [LDAP Authentication Docs](https://www.bookstackapp.com/docs/admin/ldap-auth/) have been updated to reflect these additions.
