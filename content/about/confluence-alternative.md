### What BookStack Offers

##### Free and Open Source

BookStack is 100% free to use under the MIT license. The code is fully open; Use and modify BookStack any way you like, just provide attribution if you distribute the code.

##### Self-Host However You Please

There's no push to the cloud here unless that's your preference. Whether you install on a Raspberry Pi, or stick it in AWS; It's fully up to you. You can ensure your documentation stays behind your firewall.

##### Lightweight and Speedy

Tired of seeing placeholder content while your pages load? Tired of managing bloated Java processes? BookStack is built in modern PHP and can run on lightweight systems.

##### WYSIWYG Editing Experience

BookStack uses a WYSWIYG editor at it's core, with a range of essential formatting options and features. No scary mark-up language. Ideal for mixed-skill environments.

##### Standard Content Storage Format

BookStack primarily retains content in a relatively focused and flat layer of HTML. One of our ideals is to keep the format relatively standardised for if you ever need to migrate away from BookStack.

##### System API

Our growing REST API allows the programming of automation where desired, and provides a mechanism for import where needed.

##### An Open Community

Whether it's via GitHub, Discord or our subreddit, you can discuss with and seek help from the BookStack developers & the wider community.

##### Diagrams.net Integration, Built In

Want to create diagrams in your documentation? You can jump directly into an embedded [diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/) editing session which will save directly into BookStack.

##### Authentication Options

A range of authentication options and controls are built-in including LDAP, SAML2 and a range of OAuth clients. Additionally MFA with role-based enforcement can be used with any of these.

## Migrating From Confluence to BookStack

We don't yet have an automated way to migrate your content directly from Confluence to BookStack.  
We do have a growing REST API that can be used to automate some of the process where possible.  
In the future we'd like to have some tools to assist with a migration but the opportunity  
to create such tools has not yet presented itself.
