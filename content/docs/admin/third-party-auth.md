BookStack currently supports login via a range of third party and social applications. Once enabled options for these services will show up in the login, registration and user profile pages. By default these services are disabled. To enable them you will have to create an application on the external services to obtain the require application id's and secrets.

#### Available Services

* [Google](#google)
* [GitHub](#github)
* [Twitter](#twitter)
* [Facebook](#facebook)
* [Slack](#slack)
* [AzureAD (Microsoft)](#azuread-microsoft)
* [Okta](#okta)
* [GitLab](#gitlab)
* [Twitch](#twitch)
* [Discord](#discord)

#### Automatic Registration

You may find that you'd like to auto-register users, from the login screen, when they use a social authentication option. To do this add the following `.env` option, altering the `{SERVICE}` to match the login service you are using:

```bash
{SERVICE}_AUTO_REGISTER=true

# Examples
GOOGLE_AUTO_REGISTER=true
TWITCH_AUTO_REGISTER=true
```

This will allow registration using these services even if registrations are disabled.
It also allows registration if using LDAP as your main authentication option.

#### Automatic Email Confirmation

If you trust a third-party login service you can enable automatic email confirmation. This skips the 'Confirm Email' setting, even if domain restrictions are enabled although the domain of the email address provided by the social service will still be checked. To do this add the following `.env` option, altering the `{SERVICE}` to match the login service you are using and trust:

```bash
{SERVICE}_AUTO_CONFIRM_EMAIL=true

# Examples
GOOGLE_AUTO_CONFIRM_EMAIL=true
TWITCH_AUTO_CONFIRM_EMAIL=true
```
